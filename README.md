#CPP : Contemporary Pop Phrasepedia - The CPP Slang Dictionary Using Insertion Sort Algorithm

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:

1. The mainProj1.py file is responsible for sorting the initial python dictionary which will be saved in sample.json
2. The mainProj2 is file is for inserting a new word into the updated/sorted file. Alternate the value for y in line 7 following the format {"Word/Pharse you want to add":"The meaninng of the Word/Phrase"} this will trigger a print statement "New Word Already Added!" which indicate a successful insert.
3. The GUI.py file will be the graphical user interface of the program. Running the file will display the sorted words. Scrolling down will make you look up for more words.
